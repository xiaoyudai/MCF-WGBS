# MCF-WGBS
Applying MCF-based multtest method on a WGBS dataset (Dai, X., Lin, N., Li, D., Wang, T.(2015) A non-randomized procedure for discrete multiple testing based on individual randomized test.):

Methy.R: load data, identify defferentially methylated CpG sites and identify defferentially methylated regions (DMRs)
Methy_Z.R: histogram of Z-statistics of the overlap significant CpG sites and addition significant CpG sites. 
Methy_addition_dif.R: histogram of methylation level difference of the overlap significant CpG sites and addition significant CpG sites.
Methy_power.R: number of significant CpG sites under different nominal FDR levels.
